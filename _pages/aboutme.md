{% include base_path %}

I am a post-doctoral scholar at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst studying Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience with Dr. Rebecca Spencer.

I completed my graduate training in 2024 under the supervision of Dr. Simona Ghetti at the University of California, Davis.
I graduated from Xavier University in the fall of 2015 and previously worked at Cincinnati Childrenâ€™s Hospital Medical Center.
My research interests include episodic memory development, atypical memory development, sleep, and developmental neuroimaging techniques.

In my personal time, I enjoy being a cat mom, spending time outdoors, and practicing yoga.
