<h2>My interests span the development of episodic memory and itâ€™s various contributing factors such as neural development, sleep, and language acquisition as well deviations from typical memory development.</h2>

<img src = images/"MRI_1.jpeg" align = "left"><h2 class="has-text-align-left">Emergence of Episodic Memory</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-left has-normal-font-size">Working with infants and toddlers, I am investigating the neural contributions, namely the medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, to the emergence of episodic memory.</p>

<h2 class="has-text-align-right">Atypical Memory Development</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-right has-normal-font-size">I am investigating the elements of episodic memory in the context of developmental disorders and atypical cognition, specifically in Autism Spectrum Disorder.</p>


<h2 class="has-text-align-left">Sleep & Cognition</h2>
<p class="has-text-align-left has-normal-font-size">I am beginning to investigate the neural and physiological experience of sleep as it pertains to episodic memory and cognitive development in children.</p>
